# payload-security-system-with-facial-recognition-using-esp32-cam
In this project we are going to build a security system for the payload which works autonomously as well as manually by using microcontroller board (esp32). It is interfaced with the wireless camera module and IR sensor unit. Arduino IDE is used as a coding software. We are going to implement the facial recognition algorithm into the security system which acquires the information without any physical contact by using camera module. Camera module and IR sensor captures the raw data from the envirnment, scans facial points and provides information to the microcontroller. Then algorithm present in the microcontroller  compares the information with a dataset of known faces to find a match. After analysing the data by microcontroller the end result is used to unlock the payload delivary capsule.
